# Postino & Lettore Simulation App

This Java application simulates a system with postmen (Postino) delivering mail to mailboxes (Posta) and readers (Lettore) reading the delivered mail. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) to interact with the simulation.

## Features

- **Simulation Start:** Clicking the "Start simulation" button initiates the simulation process.
- **Postino and Lettore Threads:** The application creates and starts threads for Postino and Lettore objects to simulate their activities concurrently.
- **Log Display:** The GUI displays logs of the simulation process in real-time, providing insights into the activities of Postino and Lettore.
- **End Simulation Dialog:** Upon completion of the simulation, an end dialog is displayed to inform the user.

## How to Use

1. **Run the Application:** Execute the `MainApp` class to launch the application.
2. **Start Simulation:** Click the "Start simulation" button to begin the simulation process.
3. **Monitor Logs:** Observe the logs displayed in the GUI window to track the progress of the simulation.
4. **End Simulation:** Upon completion, an end dialog will appear, indicating the end of the simulation.
