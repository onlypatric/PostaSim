# Postino & Lettore Simulation App

This Java application simulates a system with postmen (Postino) delivering mail to mailboxes (Posta) and readers (Lettore) reading the delivered mail. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) to interact with the simulation.

## Features

- **Simulation Start:** Clicking the "Start simulation" button initiates the simulation process.
- **Postino and Lettore Threads:** The application creates and starts threads for Postino and Lettore objects to simulate their activities concurrently.
- **Log Display:** The GUI displays logs of the simulation process in real-time, providing insights into the activities of Postino and Lettore.
- **End Simulation Dialog:** Upon completion of the simulation, an end dialog is displayed to inform the user.

## How to Use

Compile using one of the scripts in the directory, ".sh" file for unix systems such as MacOS or Linux, ".cmd" file for Windows NT (7, 8, 8.1, 10, 11), if you know what you're doing you can skip this part, or you can configure an IDE, this project has been built using VSCode and Java pack by Microsoft

1. **Run the Application:** Execute the `MainApp` class to launch the application.
2. **Start Simulation:** Click the "Start simulation" button to begin the simulation process.
3. **Monitor Logs:** Observe the logs displayed in the GUI window to track the progress of the simulation.
4. **End Simulation:** Upon completion, an end dialog will appear, indicating the end of the simulation.
